# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Scripts

### Install dependencies
Run `npm install` or `npm i` to download necessary dependencies. This must be run every time a dependency is
added or updated.

### Dev mode - serve the app locally
Run `npm run dev`. This will serve the app on http://localhost:3000 and should automatically open in the browser.

Note: type checking is not performed while serving locally.

### Production build
Run `npm run build`. This will perform type checking and generate the necessary bundles to deploy to the server.
The entire `build/` directory should be copied as-is to the deployment location.

### Lint
Run `npm run lint`. This will check for formatting issues and code smells.
